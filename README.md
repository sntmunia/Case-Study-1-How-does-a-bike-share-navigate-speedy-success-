Cyclistic is a bike-share program that offers inclusive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it accessible to people with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, about 8% use the assistive options. The program is popular for leisure rides, but around 30% of users also rely on it for daily commuting. Cyclistic aims to shift its marketing focus towards converting casual riders into annual members as they have proven to be more profitable. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the marketing team aims to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, determine why casual riders would consider a membership, and explore the impact of digital media on marketing strategies.
